I am currently a Senior AI Research Engineer and will soon take up the role of Academic Fellow in Multimodal AI (from March 2026) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/), [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). I am also the Assistant Head of AI Research Engineering at the [Centre for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence).

My research focuses on developing machine learning methods and tools for materials science and multimodal learning. In particular, I use multimodal AI and large language models to construct new datasets and benchmarks for materials research, and develop multimodal AI methods for improved materials property prediction using both computational and experimental data.

I am a co-founder and principal developer of [PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale), an open-source library that delivers accessible multimodal machine learning algorithms, which is featured in [PyTorch Landscape](https://landscape.pytorch.org/?item=training--multimodal--pykale) for multimodal training.

<!-- I received my Ph.D. degree in Signal and Information Processing from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2023. My academic journey began with a B.Eng. degree in Measuring Control Technology and Instruments from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) in 2016. Additionally, I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield from 2019 to 2021. -->
